1.  Install the mozilla development environment (mozilla-central).

mercurial libasound2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libnotify-dev libxt-dev libiw-dev libidl-dev mesa-common-dev autoconf2.13 yasm libgtk2.0-dev libdbus-1-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev zip unzip gcc g++ make patch 

Debian squeeze yasm-1.x from Squeeze backports

2.  Download mozilla-central from mercurial

    hg clone http://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central mozilla-2.0

3.  Download bluegriffon from svn inside mozilla-central

    cd mozilla-2.0
    svn checkout http://sources.disruptive-innovations.com/bluegriffon/tags/1.5.2/ bluegriffon

4.  Download locales from svn inside bluegriffon

    cd bluegriffon
    svn co http://sources.disruptive-innovations.com/bluegriffon-l10n/tags/1.5.2/ locales

5.  Enable the locales in bluegriffon/langpacks/Makefile.in

    I leave them all activated without touching anything

6.  We apply the "minimal patch" for mozilla-2.0

    cd mozilla-2.0
    patch -p 1 < bluegriffon/config/content.patch

    NOTE:  Several hunks had to be reviewed because the patch did not apply entirely.

    Specifically it seems that the types PRUint32 and PRInt32 have become unint32_t
    and int32_t respectively.

7.  Option 2:  Find a closest (in time) changeset to the date of the patch.

    Looking with svn log at the content.patch file in bluegriffon, I get that it comes
    from 2012-05-23.

    Looking with hg log at mercurial (and with hgview graphical GUI) I have selected a
    revision 94741, changeset 2a421f162401

    Applying the patch on that hg revision only yields one rejected.  I feel safer with this.

    111687:c6920331123e

8.  Option 3:  Use the exact changeset

    In bluegriffon/config/mozilla_central_revision, we have the
    changeset used for the patch.

    In this case, it is:  6b26bdffa1bc

    This changeset is retrieved with:

    hg checkout 6b26bdffa1bc

9.  Copy bluegriffon/config/mozconfig.ubuntu como .mozconfig

    Adjust MOZCONF_OBJDIR to a relative path outside of mozilla-2.0
